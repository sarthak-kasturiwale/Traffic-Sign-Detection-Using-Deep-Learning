# Traffic-Sign-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
- Traffic-sign recognition (TSR) is a technology by which a vehicle is able to recognize the traffic signs put on the road e.g. "speed limit" or "children" or "turn ahead".
- For an Automatic Cars the detection of the Road Signs becomes a Crusial Stuff. The technology is being developed by a variety of automotive suppliers. It uses image processing techniques to detect the traffic signs. The detection methods can be generally divided into color based, shape based and learning based methods.
- So in this project we are going to develop a Deep Learning model to detect Traffic Signs.

# Dataset Description
- The dataset consists of 43 classes.
- The dataset is distributed in 43 Folders where each folder consist of around 100 images for training.

# Important Note 
- In this Project we have also designed a GUI along with the Models.

# End Results
- We have successfully trained the Traffic Sign Detection Model using CNN.
- We got accuracy of about 93.79% on training data while 98.53 on validation data. This shows that our model is not over fitting & predicting the exact class to which it belongs.

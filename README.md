# Traffic-Sign-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
- Traffic-sign recognition (TSR) is a technology by which a vehicle is able to recognize the traffic signs put on the road e.g. "speed limit" or "children" or "turn ahead". - For an Automatic Cars the detection of the Road Signs becomes a Crusial Stuff. The technology is being developed by a variety of automotive suppliers. It uses image processing techniques to detect the traffic signs. The detection methods can be generally divided into color based, shape based and learning based methods.  - So in this project we are going to develop a Deep Learning model to detect Traffic Signs.
